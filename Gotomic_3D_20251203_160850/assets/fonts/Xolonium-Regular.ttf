# (Binary data for Xolonium-Regular.ttf would go here. For a generated project,
# I typically assume fonts are provided or use a placeholder path.)
# This file is too large to embed as plain text. In a real generation, this would be a binary blob.
# For demonstration purposes, I will represent it as a path and assume it's available.
