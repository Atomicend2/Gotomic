# Gotomic Mobile Game Project

This project is a basic Godot 4.5 mobile game generated by Gotomic, focusing on mobile compatibility and input.

## Project Structure:

*   **`scenes/`**: Contains the main game scenes.
    *   `Main.tscn`: The primary scene, launching point of the game. It instantiates the Player and HUD.
    *   `Player.tscn`: A reusable prefab for the player character.
*   **`scripts/`**: Holds all GDScript files.
    *   `PlayerController.gd`: Script for player movement and actions.
    *   `MobileInput.gd`: An Autoload (global) script to manage mobile input states, acting as a central input source for gameplay.
    *   `HUD.gd`: Script for the User Interface, connecting mobile buttons to `MobileInput` actions.
*   **`models/`**: Placeholder 3D models.
    *   `player_cube.obj`: A simple cube model for the player.
*   **`ui/`**: Contains UI specific scenes.
    *   `HUD.tscn`: The mobile HUD with virtual joystick/directional buttons and action buttons.

## Entry Points:

*   **Game Start**: `scenes/Main.tscn` is the main scene configured in `project.godot`.
*   **Player Input**:
    *   The `MobileInput` Autoload (`res://scripts/MobileInput.gd`) manages the raw state of mobile input.
    *   The `HUD.tscn` connects its `TouchScreenButton` nodes to update the state within `MobileInput`.
    *   The `PlayerController.gd` queries `MobileInput` for movement and action states.

## How to Run:

1.  Open the project in Godot 4.5.
2.  Run the `Main.tscn` scene.
3.  Use the on-screen buttons for movement and actions. (Note: Mouse clicks will emulate touch input).

## Mobile Considerations:

*   The project is configured for the "Compatibility" renderer.
*   Anti-aliasing is disabled for performance.
*   Input is handled via `TouchScreenButton` nodes in the UI, feeding into a global `MobileInput` script.
*   Placeholder models are extremely low-poly.
*   No dynamic lights or heavy post-processing are used.
